# 8 simple tricks to BOOST your godly rank!!11!!!
### An instruction manual to get you from 74 to 82 (and more?)

So you want to be a high-ranking god, HUH!? Well, while some of us are born with a certain *je ne sais quoi* that makes us worthy of worship, others (like yourself) have to work hard to ascend the godly ranks. Fortunately, there are steps you can take to boost your god level!!! (In my eyes. Which are the only eyes that matter (they are after all superhuman (aka **GODLY**)).)

## What is the GODLY scale?
While godliness is not an exact science, there are various metrics which can make the ascension process more straightforward and seamless.

1. Ability 2 fill a unique niche


  > Why should you be a god of anything? If you can answer this question, you are already on the godly path. 
  
  > The next question is: why should I care about the particular realm over which you preside, so to speak? A god of carnivores is of little interest to me. A god of pillows, on the other hand, is of immediate and crucial interest to me because pillows are *extremely important*. The more unique and valuable niches you fill, the more high-ranking you are likely to be. 


2.  Consistently good (and occasionally lame, there is a certain charm in that) humour

  > You can't just repeat "bitcoin .bash" forever.

  > You also can't repeat "I'll have to look up SchNet porn later" forever.

  > You also can't eternally recycle *My Immortal* quotes.

  > I know this imposes a lot of restrictions but why would I hardcore worship somebody who isn't able to constantly entertain me?


3. Cuteness

  > Self-explanatory -- why do you think Marta and Mercedes rank so high?


4. Answers my prayers (relatively quickly)

  > I have needs. 


5. Slightly weird and off-putting but in an alluring way?

  > Creedence the goblin queen is a good example of this. There's something **so hot** about her.


6. Can be seduced with corn

  > Self-explanatory.
